# odin-recipes
An HTML assignment, to practice building a basic website with multiple pages.

It will consist of an index page, and a few other recipe pages.

Goals: I should be able to write up the HTML of all pages, adding the relevant recipes, pictures, and links with minimal help.

No CSS required, until later on.
